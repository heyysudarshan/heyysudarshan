### Introduction ðŸ‘‹

Hi! Welcome to my GitHub profile. I'm `Sudarshan Mhasrup`, a software engineer and developer from India passionate about
cross-platform and native mobile app development using Kotlin. Since childhood, Iâ€™ve always been curious about how
computers work and how I could build my own programs that run on the web, mobile, and desktop. So, I decided to learn
programming, and it turned out to be the best decision Iâ€™ve ever made. I love building things.

I began my journey by developing mobile apps using a no-code tool called `Sketchware`. Later I explored the `Java`
programming language and began creating fun projects using `Java` and `XML`. I discovered the Kotlin programming
language when I was exploring Android development more in depth. Today Iâ€™m totally into `Kotlin`. Its multiplatform
nature allows me to develop apps that run seamlessly on mobile phones, desktop PCs, the web, and more.

I've dedicated myself to developing software, especially mobile apps and cross-platform apps, using
`Kotlin Multiplatform` and `Compose Multiplatform` for `Android`, `iOS`, `desktop`, and `web` with one single codebase.
Having a deep understanding of the `Gradle` build system makes my work easier, as I can handle multi-module projects
easily and tweak settings to improve build performance.

In addition to my skills in mobile app development, I am also involved in backend development. I share knowledge of
developing backend services using `Spring Boot` and JetBrains's `Ktor` along with `PostgreSQL` as a database solution.
Having these backend skills makes me a full-stack software developer who can handle both parts of any software.

### Technology Tech

Do you want to know the technology stack I use for writing and developing software? Donâ€™t worry, Iâ€™ve got you covered.
Hereâ€™s the list of technologies I use in my daily developer life.

### Active learning

I prefer building projects while learning a specific technology. This way has always worked for me and turned out to be
the most effective way to learn any new technology. I've created and dedicated special repositories that I use to
maintain the source code and projects that I created while learning that technology. Here is the list of all
repositories I created while learning specific technology.

- [Exploring the world of Kotlin](https://github.com/heyysudarshan/exploring-the-world-of-kotlin): I'm absolutely in
  love with Kotlin: I think about it all the time, even in my sleep! This repository showcases everything I built on my
  journey through Kotlin.
